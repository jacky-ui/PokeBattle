# PokeBattle

This was a fun little Pokemon game I created using [Pokemon API: https://pokeapi.co/)]. This was created with HTML, CSS, SASS, and JavaScript. I've also used Axios for handling HTTP requests. Currently deployed with Netlify: https://card-battles.netlify.app/.

At first I actually wanted to recreate a Pokemon battle like in the games, but I noticed that this API only provides images of a Pokemon card. Maybe I will create my own Pokemon API with images of Pokemons instead of cards.
